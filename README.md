Text Formatting Programs from Fall 2016

These programs take the lines of text files as input, read the formatting options within the files, then output the appropriately formatted text in a new output file.
To do this, the various assignments use makefiles, dynamic memory-allocation routines, error-handling, and regular-expressions.

Coded with C and Python in vim.
